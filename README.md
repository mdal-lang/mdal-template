# `mdAL` Template

This repository serves as a template for new [`mdAL`](https://mdal-lang.github.io) projects. It contains a sample `mdAL` model file, a sample [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows) and other configurations files to get you started. You can even use repositories created from this template in the online editor [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) with the `mdAL` extension pre-loaded.
